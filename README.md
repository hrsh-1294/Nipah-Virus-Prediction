# 🧠 Nipah Virus Prediction

This repository contains various machine learning models implemented in Python to predict the outbreak or risk of the **Nipah virus**, a highly contagious and deadly virus transmitted from animals to humans.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ANN.py` | Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks |
| `KNN.py` | Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors |
| `LogisticRegression.py` | Logistic Regression-based classifier |
| `RandomForest.py` | Random Forest model for prediction |
| `SVM.py` | Support Vector Machine classifier |

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to evaluate and compare different supervised learning models to:
- Predict the possibility of Nipah virus infection
- Identify key features that influence prediction
- Aid public health surveillance with intelligent tools

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for experiments)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hrsh-1294/Nipah-Virus-Prediction.git

  

2.  Navigate into the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd Nipah-Virus-Prediction



3. Run any of the model files:
   ```bash
    python ANN.py




##📊 Future Improvements
Add exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks

Implement model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, ROC-AUC)

Integrate real-time data (if available)

Create a dashboard for visualization
